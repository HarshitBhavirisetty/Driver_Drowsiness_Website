# Driver Drowsiness Detection Project

## Description
This project focuses on real-time driver drowsiness detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## Features
- Real-time drowsiness detection
- High accuracy in identifying driver fatigue

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Other dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drowsiness-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd drowsiness-detection`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Follow additional setup instructions in `docs/setup.md`

## Usage
1. Run the main script: `python main.py`
2. Integrate the drowsiness detection model into your application using the provided API.

## Dataset
The model was trained on the [Driver Drowsiness Detection Dataset](link-to-dataset).

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture consists of X layers with Y hyperparameters.

## Training Process
1. Data preprocessing steps included [...].
2. Model was trained for Z epochs.
3. Additional details in `docs/training_process.md`.
